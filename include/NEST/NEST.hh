/*

  NEST.hh and NEST.cpp are the core, the heart, the most important parts of the
  code and model.
  Here the mean light and charge yields are produced but also the fluctuations.
  The yields and fluctuated quanta are functions of the particle type, energy,
  field, and density/phase.
  The raw numbers of photons and electrons are converting into S1 and S2 as
  observed in real life.
  S1 and S2 totals have arrival timing and basic waveform digitization sim added
  on top of them well.
  Lastly, the NEST functions handle a few more advanced detector property
  calculations.
  You'll find the drift v, density as a function of T and P, and XY position
  resolution smearing.

/* *** A word on the units for variables! ***

   distances/lengths are typically mm although a few may be in cm. Velocity
   always uses mm and field always uses cm
   energies are in keV. Work functions are eV sometimes and converted internally
   inside of functions
   fields can be either V/cm or kV/cm, depending on what is most natural for a
   given problem
   times generally end up in ns (and NOT 100 MHz "samples" e.g.) If us or rarely
   ms they're each ultimately converted
   - Microseconds are used as the initial units for drift time, before final
   conversions into ns for digitized pulses
   The magnitude of the drift velocity is given in mm per us, another exception
   to the ns rule
   Temperatures must be in Kelvin not Celsius and pressures are always in bar
   (absolute)
   S1 and S2 units vary from photons and electrons to photo-electrons (labeled
   PE or phe since there are 2 conventions)
   - phd or dph or "photons detected" or "detected photons" refers to PE after
   2pe effect is approximately averaged out (reduction by ~20%)
   - Spikes refer to an attempt at photon counting, hits in PMTs, improving S1
   resolution compared to traditional smeared area
   Even before XYZ position corrections, a spike does not have to be a whole
   number due to things like probabilistic overlap bias correction
   Expect mass densities to be in grams per cm^3 or mL. If atomic density is
   needed, then we derive it
   Particles like photons, electrons, excitons, ions are unit-less, as are the
   "Nuisance Parameters" (multiplicative factors on yields)
   - Event number also dimensionless, and follows C++ convention of starting at
   0, not at 1, for the first event in your simulation
   Probabilities are all initially fractional even if converted to percentages
   for display purposes
   A=atomic mass, Z=mass number (#protons) for simulating the yields of random
   non-noble ions/atoms traveling through medium.
   - These are round numbers even if input as double's since go into
   calculations with other doubles as a mixture
   The interaction type ("species") is a new type defined for use in NEST that
   attempts to cover all possible kinds of particle/scatter
   For waveforms (with output timing set to TRUE) the unit is PE per bin
   (sample, usually 10 ns) but has option of total area in PE
